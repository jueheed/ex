HBCA case C76768686567 reviewed the accounts of Jong CHEN.
Previous reviews of the clients resulted in STR-R166788765 (21Dec2016), 
STR-R999988876 (21Dec2016), STR-R877656789 (09Dec2018), being filed.
Investigation of HBCA client Jong CHEN identified a   wire transfer from a third party 
individual that was used to facilitate multiple cash withdrawals.  A continuation of 
previously reported activity was observed.  Memo on the wire also conflicts with 
observed activity.  As such, there are reasonable grounds to suspect the activity as 
being a money laundering offence.

Investigation of account #111-111111-123 identified multiple cash withdrawals 
(total of CAD 30,200.00) that were mainly funded by two incoming wire transfers from a 
third party individual; Jackie CHEN (total of CAD 45,300.00).  While it   is reasonable to 
infer that the remitter has familial ties to the client, the activity appears to be 
a continuation of previous reported activity.  According to previous correspondence, 
client noted that he?s being funded by his parents for overseas study.  However, 
source of funds remains unverified and the cash withdrawals were rapidly depleted in 
separate occasions at different branch locations; indicative of flow through.  Memo on 
the wires noted that they were for tuition purposes, however this may conflict with 
observed activity as the funds were withdrawn subsequently in cash.  Ultimate destination 
of funds remains unknown.  As such, there are reasonable grounds to suspect the activity 
above as being potential commission of a money laundering related offence.
